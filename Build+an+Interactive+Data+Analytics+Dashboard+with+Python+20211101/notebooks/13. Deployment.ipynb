    "# Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll learn how to deploy our application on a remote server so that it is accessible on the web by anyone from anywhere. Two deployment options will be shown. First, will be an easy (and free) option with  [PythonAnywhere.com][1]. In the second option we'll set up an Ubuntu server on our own. This option is more complex, targeted for those that want full control, and costs a few dollars per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a web server?\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the chapter on web development, the [MDN documentation on web servers][2] is a great introduction, and an important read if you have no experience with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've run our application from our local machine by executing the command `python dashboard.py`, but this only allows us to access the application from our localhost. Nobody else can view our dashboard besides us. In order to allow others access to our application, we'll need web server software such as Apache2 or NginX (pronounced \"Engine-X\") to **serve** our website to **clients** that **request** it using the **HTTP** protocol. Some definitions of common terms follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Serve (verb) - the transferring of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, PDFs, etc...) from server to client\n",
    "* Server - the machine running the web server software and hosting the files to be served to the client\n",
    "* Client - user (a human or another machine) that makes requests, typically with a web browser\n",
    "* Request - a specific message that the client sends to the server to take an action. The message is precisely defined by the HTTP protocol. The most common requests are `GET` and `POST`.\n",
    "* HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol - A specific protocol that defines exactly how to make each type of request\n",
    "* Response - a message from the server in response to a client request - Comes with a status code (i.e. 200, 404, 500)\n",
    "\n",
    "The image below (from MDN with added annotations) depicts this process of a client (you on your computer using a web browser) making requests for content from a server (a machine probably in a warehouse hosting files for https://coronavirus.dunderdata.com). For example, when a user clicks on one of the countries in the data table, a `GET` request is made from the browser to the server. The `dashboard.py` file on the server runs the code within the callback and makes a response with the new HTML and CSS. Your browser will then interpret this response and render the updates on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "![3]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where are these servers and how do I get one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Any computer connected to the internet can work as a web server. Even your personal machine has the ability to become a web server. Most people don't use their own machines as web servers as they would need to keep it running at all times and have enough resources to serve content to all the clients. Some individuals will buy machines, set them up in their homes, and dedicate them to hosting their web sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often, the better choice is to rent a computer from a company to use as a web server. The company will be responsible for managing all of the hardware and keeping the computer up and running. There are a huge number of companies that rent web servers, with the biggest names being Amazon (with AWS), Microsoft (with Azure), and Google (with Google Cloud). While these companies offer good servers, the overwhelming number of services makes it difficult (in my opinion) to navigate their platforms. They also cost more than a company like Vultr, which we will use. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I control this web server?\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the computer acting as the web server, you'll have to log into it. Most companies provide you access to their servers from a web browser. You just log into your online account and find the **console**, which opens up a command line interface running on the server's machine. A few companies, such as Python Anywhere, have a web interface that allows you to control many of the server functions, such as uploading files, using point and click.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also log in from your local computer using a **Secure Shell** or **ssh**, which establishes a secure connection between your machine and the server. Using ssh will drop you into the command line on the server.\n",

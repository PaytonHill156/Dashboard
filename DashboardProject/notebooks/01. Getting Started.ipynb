    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **Build an Interactive Data Analytics Dashboard with Python**. You will be building the Coronavirus Forecasting Dashboard available for viewing at [coronavirus-project.dunderdata.com][1]. At the end of this course, you'll have all the skills to launch your own dashboard using Dash on a remote web server for the world to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Components\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is divided into the following five major components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data preparation (Chapters 2-4)\n",
    "* Model building (Chapters 5-7)\n",
    "* Code organization (Chapters 8-9)\n",
    "* Application development (Chapters 10-12)\n",
    "* Deployment (Chapter 13)\n",
    "\n",
    "[1]: https://coronavirus-project.dunderdata.com\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by ensuring that we can run the dashboard application from our local machine. The only necessary software before getting started is Python 3.7 or above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install necessary packages\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several third-party Python libraries that need to be installed in order to run the dashboard. After downloading all of the course contents, open up the command prompt/terminal and change directories so that you are in the **project** directory of this course. You should see several python files, some folders, and a requirements.txt file containing a list of all the necessary packages. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Creating a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you create a virtual environment at this point dedicated to this project. Within this virtual environment, you will install all the necessary packages needed to launch the dashboard. Take the following steps to create the virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your terminal/command prompt and activate your current Python environment. This may not be necessary if your environment is automatically active or if the `python` command maps to the version of Python you wish to run in the virtual environment.\n",
    "1. `cd` into the `project` directory\n",
    "1. Run the command **`python -m venv dashboard_venv`** to create the virtual environment. A new folder called `dashboard_venv` will be created.\n",
    "1. Activate this virtual environment using one of the following commands. Afterwards, you'll see \"(dashboard_venv)\" prepended to your prompt.\n",
    "    * macOS and Linux users - run the command **`source dashboard_venv/bin/activate`**\n",
    "    * Windows users - run the command **`dashboard_venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat`**\n",
    "1. Run **`pip install -U pip`** to upgrade pip to the latest version\n",
    "1. Run **`pip install wheel`** to install the wheel package, which helps install the other packages\n",
    "1. Run **`pip install -r requirements.txt`** to install all the necessary packages into this environment. This will take some time to complete.\n",
    "1. Run **`pip install jupyter matplotlib`** to install Jupyter Notebook and matplotlib into this environment. These libraries are NOT part of the requirements as they are only necessary for the course and not for deployment in production\n",
    "1. Run **`pip install jupyter-dash==0.4`** to install Jupyter-Dash, a library for creating dashboards with Dash within a Jupyter Notebook. It too is only required for the course and not deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launching the dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the environment, installing all of the packages, and while still in the project directory, remain on the command line and run the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `python dashboard.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Right after running this command, you'll get a message informing you that the Dash app is running at http://127.0.0.1:8050. This will be followed by a message warning you not to use this method in production. Deployment on a production server will be covered at the end of this course. We'll use this simple method to run our app until then.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing the dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8050 in your browser (most terminals allow you to open web pages via ctrl + click) to see the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Dashboard features\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this dashboard is to show historical and future predicted deaths and cases of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic for all countries and US states. The dashboard is set to show its \"current\" data at the date the last time this course was updated. In the future, you'll learn how to update the dashboard with new data. The dashboard is interactive and meant for the user to explore different views by clicking on different text, tabs, and radio buttons. There are three major components of the dashboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Table of data on the left\n",
    "* Line and bar graphs of both deaths and cases in the upper right\n",
    "* Maps of the world and US states in the lower right\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two separate views, **World** and **US States**, offered by the dashboard as tabs above the data table on the left. The world view is selected by default and shows data for all countries in the world. Switching to US States shows all 50 US States plus its territories. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data table on the left is sorted by deaths by default. You should notice that each area is underlined, indicating to the user that it is clickable, with the top area selected in red. The three graphs in the upper right correspond to the selected area in the table. All three graphs show the same data, actual and predicted deaths/cases as cumulative (default), daily, and weekly totals. The map on the bottom right colors each area with respect to the absolute or per capita deaths/cases. Explore the dashboard now by clicking on all of the different views to verify it is working properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stopping the dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop the dashboard, go back to the command line and press `ctrl + C + C`, which will exit the program and bring up a new prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivate and reactivate the environment in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "If you created a virtual environment, you can deactivate it now by running the **`deactivate`** command. In the future, when you want to run this dashboard again, you'll need to reactivate the environment by running **`source dashboard_venv/bin/activate`** from the project directory. Then you can run **`python dashboard.py`** to launch the dashboard."
